    "This notebook demonstrate yeast fedbatch cultivation. We look at impact of changes in the glucose feeding. We also take a look at tuning of the DO-control system. Both liquid- and gasphase are included in the model. The culture growth and metabolism are formulated in relation to to the cells respiratory capacity [1] as well as oxygen limitation in the reactor. The model is exapanded to describe also the gas phase as well as the culture heat production [2]. The model was derived mainly from continuous culture data but proved to capture dynamic aspects well of ethanol production and consumption [3]. Several cultivations where donw with ethnol control that facilatated high cell density cultivations [4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction with the compiled model as FMU is mainly through the simplified commands: par(), init(), newplot(), simu() etc. The last simulation is always available in the workspace and called 'sim_res'. The command describe() brings mainly up description infomration from the actual Modelica code from the FMU but is complemented with information given in the dedicated Python setup-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to demonstrate how simulations and varyiing conditions can provide some process insight that can support the experimetnal work. I hope that at the end of this session you are ready to formulate your own questions you want to address with simulations - and you can just go on in this notebook! Just press the field \"+Code\" in the upper left part of notebook interface and you get a new \"cell\" where you write your own code. You can copy and paste from cells above using ctrol-c and ctrl-p as usual and edit the cell. When your are ready to execute the cell just press the \"play button\" to the left in the cell or press shift-enter as in \"ordinary\" Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "After a session you may want to save your own notebook. That you can do on your Google Drive account and I refer to Colab instructions for how to do this. It is easy. \n",

    "The detailed understanding of process dynamics at very low dissolved oxygen levels is not that well studied, to the authors knowledge. Here is a section on \"Growth under oxygen limiation\" in the original paper [1]. This model we use here. The idea is that the oxygen uptake is essentially described with a Monod-function with a parameter here denoted KsO2. At higher dissolved oxygen levels the uptake is saturated by the respiratory capacity and in our model denoted qO2max. Thus, at lower dissolved oxygen levels the respiration capacity is lowered and denoted here qO2lim and at sufficiently high dissolved oygen levels the qO2lim corresponds to qO2max. The value of qO2lim controls metabolism and growth. \n",

It would be interesting to make similar studies at low dissolved oxygens levels.

    "During the time 1980-90 there was an interest to study the impact variation in dissolved oxygen in two-reactor setups [5]. In the smaller reactor dissolved oxygen level was low while higher in the larger reactor and the culture was circulated in the system at a rate related to typical mixing times in a large reactor. This experimental setup has been simulated with Bioprocess Library with focus on substrate gradients rather than oxygen gradients [6]. "
