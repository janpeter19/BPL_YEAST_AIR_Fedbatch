    "This notebook demonstrate yeast fedbatch cultivation. We look at impact of changes in the glucose feeding. We also take a look at tuning of the DO-control system. Both liquid- and gasphase are included in the model. The culture growth and metabolism are formulated in relation to to the respiratory capacity [1] and the model is exapanded to describe also the gas phase as well as  the culture heat production [2]. The model was derived mainly from continuous culture data but proved to capture dynamic aspects well of ethanol production and consumption [3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction with the compiled model as FMU is mainly through the simplified commands: par(), init(), newplot(), simu() etc. The last simulation is always available in the workspace and called 'sim_res'. The command describe() brings mainly up description infomration from the actual Modelica code from the FMU but is complemented with information given in the dedicated Python setup-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to demonstrate how simulations and varyiing conditions can provide some process insight that can support the experimetnal work. I hope that at the end of this session you are ready to formulate your own questions you want to address with simulations - and you can just go on in this notebook! Just press the field \"+Code\" in the upper left part of notebook interface and you get a new \"cell\" where you write your own code. You can copy and paste from cells above using ctrol-c and ctrl-p as usual and edit the cell. When your are ready to execute the cell just press the \"play button\" to the left in the cell or press shift-enter as in \"ordinary\" Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a session you may want to save your own notebook. That you can do on your Google Drive account and I refer to Colab instructions for how to do this. It is easy. \n",

    "Enjoy!"
