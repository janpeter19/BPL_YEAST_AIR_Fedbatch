# BPL_YEAST_AIR_Fedbatch

This example of cultivation of yeast culture using fedbatch technique is realistic up to about a volume 1000 L.
The model describes by-product (ethanol) formation at over-feeding as well as gas phase of oxygen, carbon dioxide
and even smaller amount of ethanol. Simulation is done using an FMU from Bioprocess Library *for* Modelica. Below a diagram
with a typical simulation that you will get at the ned of the Jupyter notebook.

The installation takes just a few minutes. The subsequent execution of the simulations of microbial growth take just a second or so. You can continue in the notebook and make new simulations and follow the examples given.

Note that:
* The script occassionaly get stuck during installation. Then just close the notebook and start from scratch.
* Runtime warnings are at the moment silenced. The main reason is that we run with an older combination of PyFMI and Python that bring depracation warnings of little interest. 
* Remember, you need to have a google-account!

Just to be clear, no installation is done at your local computer.
